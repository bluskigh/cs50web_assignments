Creating a new listing is simple, provide a form that contains an input for 
the title, text description, starting bid, and optional image.

Active listing page is relatively simple, its the default route and should
display all currently active listings. This information should be displayed:
title, description, current price, and photo(if exists)

Listing page is just like an page that shows specific detail about a certain 
listing. If user is signed in then the following can be done: 
dislay option to add to watchlist, if item is already in watchlist user should 
be able to remove it, user can bid on the item (must be as large as starting bid, 
and greater than any other bids, otherwise if criteria not met display error),
if user is owner then ability to close the auction showed be displayed(highest 
bid the winner, and listing no longer active). Following is for users who do
not own the listing: on closed listing page, and user won the auction page
should say so, comments can be added (listing page should show those comments). 

Watchlist page should display all the listings that the user has saved, clicking
on them should redirect user to the appropriate listing page.

Category page should display all categories, clicking on a category should display
a page with results of listing under thus category.

Django admin interface (look at website for these specifications)


Add myself:
add date created, and add when it ends, so on the active listings page show
when it was created and how much time left until automaically closed.
